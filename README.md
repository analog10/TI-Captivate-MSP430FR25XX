# TI-Captivate-MSP430FR25XX
(WIP) A copy of TI's CapTIVate software library for the MSP430FR25XX family, hopefully compilable using the standard msp430-elf-gcc toolchain

**NOTE: not currently working**
I'm probably going to switch to using CCS and their design tool in the meantime to finish my project, and then switch back over to getting this working when I have more bandwidth.
There are currently a lot of linker errors and some problems will getting the code to fit on the MSP430FR2512, so hopefully getting it working using CCS will help with getting it working on MSP430-GCC.

## Description
So this comes bundled with TI's CapTIVate design center thing, but it seems a lot more convenient to be able to add it as a Git submodule instead of having to deal with the library the whole time.
Luckily the code is licensed as BSD, so this is a totally okay thing to do as far as I can tell.
I'm working and testing with the MSP430FR2512, so YMMV
