# TI-Captivate-MSP430FR25XX
(WIP) A copy of TI's CapTIVate software library for the MSP430FR25XX family, hopefully compilable using the standard MSP-GCC toolchain

** NOTE: note currently working **

## Description
So this comes bundled with TI's CapTIVate design center thing, but it seems a lot more convenient to be able to add it as a Git submodule instead of having to deal with the library the whole time.
Luckily the code is licensed as BSD, so this is a totally okay thing to do as far as I can tell.
I'm working and testing with the MSP430FR2512, so YMMV
